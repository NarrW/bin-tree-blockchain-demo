### Fraud Detection with Hashed Binary Tree on Simple Blockchain Network

[Introduction]
Blockchain technology has performed important roles to overcome conventional challenges in various areas. Especially, it has proposed novel solutions for secured currency transaction systems. Meanwhile, it currently faces many technical problems such as speed. The speed problem is directly related to the scalability issues and to maximize utility of the network, it is essential to solve the problem. Also, this speed issues mainly derived from security. Due to the nature of the distributed ledger, it is clear that this tradeoff is inevitable. As the size of the ledger grows, the index speed must decrease significantly. Therefore, it is challenging to examine the correspondence between remote peers and to find fraud blocks.
